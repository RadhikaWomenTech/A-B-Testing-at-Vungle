Vungle's core business is in mobile in-app video advertising. Vungle management is
considering using a new ad-serving algorithm. Kritzer and Guerin have proposed a new ad-
serving algorithm that might be more effective than the one currently used at Vungle. The main
objective of this experiment is to determine if this new algorithm can improve Vungle's key
performance metric: effective revenue per thousand impressions, eRPM.
Vungle is one of the key leading players in in-app video advertising, founded in 2011.
Vungle had mobile apps embedded with video ads that encouraged users to install more apps. In
this process, there were four major stakeholders: the publisher of the app, the mobile device user,
the sponsor of video ad, and the platform that matched the ads.
It has grown into one of the most influential platforms in mobile advertising, with a reach
to over 100 million users every month. The company derives most of its revenue from ad
conversions, specifically through app installs from these video ads. The first year for Vungle was
too expensive and did not bring in the revenue they had projected. The turning point in Vungle's
history came with the receipt of 120,000 dollars as seed funding in 2012.
This case study will help evaluate, with the help of machine learning, a newly developed
ad-serving algorithm created by Kritzer and Guerin. The primary objective was to see whether
the new algorithm could outperform the current Vungle algorithm in serving ads better to align
with past user engagement data in an effort to maximize ad conversions and increase the eRPM.

Problem Statement

Vungle’s main business revolves around offering a platform that allows developers to
seamlessly place video ads within their mobile apps. The company's revenue is driven by the
performance of these ads, particularly by metrics such as impressions, click-through rates, and
3
conversions. Its primary revenue model, known as cost-per-install (CPI), ensures that advertisers
are charged only when users download an app after viewing an ad. This approach directly ties
Vungle’s success to the effectiveness of the ad in prompting user installations.
The challenge for Vungle is increasing user engagement and more conversions within its
ad-serving platform. Even small improvements in click-through rates or conversion rates have
the potential to yield significant revenue gains for the company. An opportunity may exist with
the development of a new machine-learning-driven ad-serving algorithm, and thus calls for a
carefully structured A/B test to evaluate its effectiveness.
